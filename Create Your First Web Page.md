# Create Your First Web Page
Let’s create your first HTML page. You must open the text editor of your choice, this time we are using ‘TextEdit’. Then type:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First HTML Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hi everyone!</h1>
		<p>This is My First HTML Page</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

And save the file with the Web Page (.html) file format:

![Save the file](introhtml/img1.png)

Finally, in your web browser go to File and click Open File. You must find the HTML you just created and open it. Should be like this:

![Result](introhtml/img2.png)

Now, congratulations! You just created your first HTML page!
